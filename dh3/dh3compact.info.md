# DH3 Compact

A simple and tiny userstyle that will make DH3 a little compact, and look better.

## Installation

If you're using [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe), I'm sorry, but this extension isn't supported when installing userstyles from Greasyfork, but you can install [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)! Stylus is fully supported, and it also supports customization by the user, as far as the userstyle has any ofc

When e.g. Stylus is installed, you'll be able to click the `Install as user style` button above, then Stylus will ask you to install it, and you should be able to use the style instantly, even if the game is running in another tab, so you don't have to reload the game!

Additionally, `Install this script` is possible, but it's untested, so it might or might not work in a different way than installing with Stylus, but it does at least work with Tampermonkey if you don't want Stylus or any similar working extensions.
